 During login we are genarating a token which has a payload of the following structure
{
  "userId": 9,
  "email": "helal@zohomail.in",
  "iat": 1702366097
}
during endpoints like /chat/sendMessage we are sending the token as headers
like axios.get("endPoint",{ headers: { Authorization: token } })
we extract the token and decode the user using jwt.verify
If the token is valid,  retrieves the corresponding user from the db and attaches it to the request (req.user).
If any error occurs, it logs the error and sends a 401 Unauthorized response with { success: false }.
